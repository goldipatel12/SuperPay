## Benefits of SuperPay for Vendors and Consumersüßê:

#### Vendors Benefits:

- Recurring payments is extremely rare in cryptocurrency space, SuperPay supports this which gives SAAS based companies to implement their business model .

- Acceptance of credit card payments generates vulnerability for sellers for charge backs, which can be extremely hurtful as they incur losses. With crypto currency payments, they do not have to worry about chargebacks.

#### Consumers Benefits:

- While Paying a vendor with plastic or digital money such as credit-card, fiat payment gateways these means stores the user sensitive information which can be used to access funds even if the payment is not recurring. This makes users extremely vulnerable as in case of a data leak, their finances will be at risk. With SuperPay, only their public wallet address is stored, which cannot be used to access funds.

- Companies make a good amount of sale with users forget to cancel subscriptions but with SuperPay's smart invoices the users cannot be charged until unless they themselves wants to make transactions.


## Challengesüî•:

The concept of data storage on Solana was a little different and I found it a bit challenging to grasp in the beginning, but the official Solana documentation is very good especially the one for accounts and their ownership helped me a lot throughout but it was a very fun experience.
